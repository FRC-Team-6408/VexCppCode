## Utility OS

This is a utility program for interacting with the v5 brain.

Some (planned) features are:
- Interacting with motors.
- Creating autonomous codes and saving them to the sd card. (using a self-created markdown language)
- Viewing & editing SD card files manually.
- Viewing the vision sensor & editing signatures.

**Note:**
The ```.cpp``` file and the ```.vex``` file are not guaranteed to have the same contents, make sure to merge them properly before editing either. (or assume .cpp is the newest version)
